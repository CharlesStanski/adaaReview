A binary heap is a nearly complete binary tree filled on all levels except possibly the lowest level where leaves are pushed left-most. Heaps are usually implemented as an array. If a binary heap contains 100 elements (nodes), what is the height of the corresponding binary tree?

A binary heap is a nearly complete binary tree filled on all levels except possibly the lowest level where leaves are pushed left-most. Heaps are usually implemented as an array. An array A that represents a heap is an object with two attributes. What are the two attributes needed?

Your Answer:
The objects that make up the heap need to keep track of 1) a value, so that each object can be compared, and 2) index so that it is possible to keep track of where each object belongs.

A 2-3 tree is a tree in which each vertex which is not a leaf has 2 or 3 sons, and every path from the root to a leaf is of the same length. What is the range of the number of leaves in a 2-3 tree of height h?

Your Answer:
between (2^h to 3^h) + 1

A 2-3 tree is a tree in which each vertex which is not a leaf has 2 or 3 sons, and every path from the root to a leaf is of the same length. The time to find an element in 2-3 tree is proportional to the height of the tree. If a 2-3 tree has n elements, what is the search time in O-notation in terms of n?
